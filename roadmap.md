# ADA Roadmap: Oct 2020 - 

## Rapid Publishing to GitHub

  - [Webbook implementation](development.md) - Website generation using GitHub Page as a replacing for Markdown Hugo/Jekyll frameworks with WebBook Level 1 (Unofficial Proposal Draft by Daniel Glazman combined with Publication Manifest W3C Proposed Recommendation 01 October 2020 https://www.w3.org/TR/pub-manifest/ - using naming of publication.json - [see issue](https://github.com/Health-Sprints/obp/issues/3).

  The reason for this Webbook implementation is that a Markdown conversion is not needed at this point in the workflow. That Markdown involves lossy conversion and problems with publication part, e.g., tables, picture captions, etc. Markdown can be part of the workflow - as na authoring format and output format but for our workflow not in this position in the workflow.
