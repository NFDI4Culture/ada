# Publishing From the Archive

A workflow guide: processes, task, and systems

Question: What are the similarities in the space of exploration and challenges for 'digitality' (sorry horrible word) between a historical single edition, volume, or collection and the need to digitally catalog such works - and the requirement of a contemporary and new 'born digital' book pubication and the need to make the work fully digital?

## System options, recommendations:

  - Photography: Digital photos and scanning
  - Cataloging
  - PIDs, LOD, Graphs, controlled vocabs (depends in use case)
    - Graph of a collection
      - Semantic Research Platforms: Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (SARI) and the Reference Data Service (RDS)
