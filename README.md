## Summary

Semantic Publishing is a new open-source software research project contributing to the techstack for the creation of multi-format textbooks. A new generation of textbooks that includes modern Open Science digital objects, has semantic layers for structure and meaning, and packaging for interoperability. We are focusing on a specific book type ‘the textbook’ as an integrated part of MOOCs. The project is based at the Open Science Lab – TIB and contributes to the German consortium of the National Research Infrastructure for Culture (NFDI4Culture). 

## Roadmap

Background: The project is built on top of work already carried out at the Open Science Lab, TIB on multi-format and multi-channel book publishing, see [Advanced Documennt Architecture (ADA)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3626810), [Rapid Health Publishing](https://github.com/TIBHannover/Rapid-Collaborative-Health-Publishing) and [TIB book sprints](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/knowledge-and-technology-transfer/services-and-consulting-offered-by-tib/book-sprints).

#### History

The research came out of work done over 2020 on Rapid Publishing in Public Health training related to the COVID pandemic when TIB's book sprint research had to be deployed at speed - nine books were produced over 2020 with over 100 medical professionals taking part.

## About NFDI4Culture

The Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage (NFDI4Culture)

The aim of NFDI4Culture is to establish a demand-oriented infrastructure for research data on material and immaterial cultural assets. This includes 2D digitised reproductions of paintings, photographs and drawings as well as 3D digital models of culturally and historically important buildings, monuments or audiovisual data of music, film and stage performances. Concept and structure of the consortium were developed over two years in an open process and in close cooperation between 11 professional societies, 9 supporting institutions and 52 partners. The consortium addresses the needs of a broad spectrum of disciplines from architecture, art, music, theatre, dance, film and media studies.
