# Specifictions for structured form creation using Fidus Writer / Vivliostyle

Example of for use of Fidus: Typewiser https://www.typewiser.com/

## Dates / schedule

## Needed

  - Example form
  - Dev environment - this could be Snap install run by Fidus on internal machine?
  - Idea of structuring of data we want
  - Get hold of Fidus Documentation
  - Build an outline of the resources needed and work packages

## Objective

Proof of concept of structured online form submission service:

  - To make a demo 'proof of concept' of a customisable form submission for reporting of grants.
  - Use Fidus Writer as the form building and user content inputting.
  - Output form as structured data for input into another system - depositing a machine readable format on GitHub would be a satisfactory target
  - Output form as PDF with structured data embeded 

## Technical issues / parts

### User authentication

SSO via GitHub as example: already exists

### Admin of forms

Admin of form means having form in a workflow that an admin can check on a dashboard to see info about a form, e.g., status in workflow, related support tickets raised.

Out of scope - focus is on form making, form content structure.

### Form buiding, customisation

  - Use Fidus Writer template builder - @simon to get docs on this.

### Form authoring

  - This is done by the user selecting a document type
  - The user can invite colleagues to edit, or to comments and review

### Form submission

  - To be worked out. Currently Fidus is setup as a document creation system which can save in systems, download, or export to external system like GitHub.

### Form structured data

  - We need to define how we want to structure data - fields?
  - What type of validation would be carrie out.
